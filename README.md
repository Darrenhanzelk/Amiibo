# Welcome to the Amiibo Database
I have uploaded every Amiibo .Bin and .NFC file I could get my hands on.
I have **NOT** tested all of these but I have tested *most*, so please let me know if there is a problem.

## What do I do with these?
Amiibo data are stored on the physical Amiibo as a .bin file.

**.Bin file** - raw data from physical Amiibo

**.NFC file** - the file needed to write to an NFC tag/card or send via nfc to your switch, this emulates a physical Amiibo. 

*Note:* You won't need the .bin files unless you just want them as some sort of backup. You would need to convert them to nfc if you wanted to use them. **[Most likely you're only here for the .nfc files](https://github.com/AmiiboDB/Amiibo/tree/main/Amiibo%20NFC "Most likely you're only here for the .nfc files").**

I have included a rough "how-to" guide explaining what you would need to use to write the .nfc to a tag or how to emulate it directly to your Switch.

If you need assistance converting .bin to .nfc or the other way around, feel free to email me as I have a custom python script I use for conversion.
